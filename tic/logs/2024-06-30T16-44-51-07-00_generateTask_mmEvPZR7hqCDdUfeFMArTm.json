This could increase demand for skills in AI management, data analysis, and complex problem-solving.\n\n3. **New Job Creation:** AI is expected to create new job categories and opportunities in fields such as AI development, maintenance, and oversight, as well as in industries that emerge as a result of AI advancements.\n\n4. **Economic Ine",
