This can lead to the strengthening of that behavior over time, as individuals learn to associate the behavior with positive outcomes. For example, if a child receives praise or a treat for completing their homework, they are more likely to complete their homework again in the future.",

Relative humidity, on the other hand, is a percentage that indicates how much water vapor is present in the air compared to the maximum amount of water vapor the air can hold at a given temperature. In other words, relative humidity tells you how \"full\" the air is with moisture relative to its capacity.",

Examples include propositional logic and predicate logic.\n\nInformal logic, on the other hand, deals with everyday reasoning and arguments presented in natural language. It focuses on the content and context of arguments, evaluating their strength, relevance, and persuasiveness rather than just their formal structure. Informal logic often examines fallacies, rhetorical strategies, and the practical aspects of reasoning in real-world situations.\n\nIn summary, the key difference lies in the approach: formal logic is concerned with the structure of arguments using symbols, while informal logic focuses on the content and context of arguments in natural language.",
