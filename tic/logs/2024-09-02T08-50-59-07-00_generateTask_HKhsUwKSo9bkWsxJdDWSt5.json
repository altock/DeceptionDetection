It reflects the degree to which personal circumstances, such as family background and socioeconomic status, influence an individual's opportunities and outcomes in life. High social mobility indicates that people can improve their social standing regardless of their starting point, while low social mobility suggests that social class is more rigid and that opportunities for advancement are limited.",
