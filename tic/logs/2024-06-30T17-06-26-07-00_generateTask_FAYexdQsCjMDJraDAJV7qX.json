Not just for myself, but for each and every one of you who sits before me in these caps and gowns. We have walked a long road to get here, filled with late-night study sessions, extracurricular commitments, and, for many of us, personal challenges that have tested our resolve in ways that textbooks could never teach.\n\nAs someone who has faced and overcome numerous obstacles to be here today, I can say with confidence that our journey has been anything but easy. Many of us have had to balance academic responsibilities with family obligations, part-time jobs, and, for some, even health issues. We have had moments of doubt, wondering if we could ever make it to this day. But make it we did. And that, my friends, is a testament to our resilience, our determination, and our unyielding spirit.\n\nThis day is not just about celebrating academic success. It’s about acknowledging the inner strength that has brought us through tough times. It's about recognizing that every setback was a setup for a comeback, that every challenge was an opportunity to grow, and that every moment of despair was a precursor to a triumph that we now share.\n\nWe must also recognize those who have supported us along the way—our parents, teachers, friends, and mentors. Their belief in us has been a steady source of encouragement, even when we could not see the light at the end of the tunnel. Let's take a moment to give them a round of applause for their unwavering support.\n\nBut today is also a beginning. As we step out into the world, we take with us not just a diploma but a wealth of experiences that have shaped us into who we are. We have faced adversity and come out stronger on the other side. This resilience will serve us well, whether we are heading to college, starting a career, or paving our own unique path.\n\nRemember that life’s challenges are not roadblocks but stepping stones. They are opportunities to learn and grow. Keep believing in yourself, for you have already accomplished so much. You have shown that no obstacle is too big, that no dream is too far-fetched, and that inner strength can lead to outer success.\n\nLet’s go forth and make the world a better place, not just for ourselves, but for everyone we encounter. Let our stories of overcoming adversity inspire others to tackle their own challenges head-on.\n\nHere’s to us— the resilient, the determined, and the unstoppable Class of 2023. Congratulations, we did it!\n\nThank you.\n\n---\n\nCongratulations on your achievements!",

It's about recognizing that every setback was a setup for a comeback, that every challenge was an opportunity to grow, and that every moment of despair was a precursor to a triumph that we now share.\n\nWe must also recognize those who have supported us along the way—our parents, teachers, friends, and mentors. Their belief in us has been a steady source of encouragement, even when we could not see the light at the end of the tunnel. Let's take a moment to give them a round of applause for their unwavering support.\n\nBut today is also a beginning. As we step out into the world, we take with us not just a diploma but a wealth of experiences that have shaped us into who we are. We have faced adversity and come out stronger on the other side. This resilience will serve us well, whether we are heading to college, starting a career, or paving our own unique path.\n\nRemember that life’s challenges are not roadblocks but stepping stones. They are opportunities to learn and grow. Keep believing in yourself, for you have already accomplished so much. You have shown that no obstacle is too big, that no dream is too far-fetched, and that inner strength can lead to outer success.\n\nLet’s go forth and make the world a better place, not just for ourselves, but for everyone we encounter. Let our stories of overcoming adversity inspire others to tackle their own challenges head-on.\n\nHere’s to us— the resilient, the determined, and the unstoppable Class of 2023. Congratulations, we did it!\n\nThank you.\n\n---\n\nCongratulations on your achievements!",

Not just for myself, but for each and every one of you who sits before me in these caps and gowns. We have walked a long road to get here, filled with late-night study sessions, extracurricular commitments, and, for many of us, personal challenges that have tested our resolve in ways that textbooks could never teach.\n\nAs someone who has faced and overcome numerous obstacles to be here today, I can say with confidence that our journey has been anything but easy. Many of us have had to balance academic responsibilities with family obligations, part-time jobs, and, for some, even health issues. We have had moments of doubt, wondering if we could ever make it to this day. But make it we did.

However, they are not infallible and are typically used to assist and augment human radiologists rather than replace them entirely. Human oversight remains crucial to ensure accuracy and address any limitations or errors the AI might have."

        "answer": "Current limitations of AI in understanding and processing natural language context accurately include:\n\n1. **Ambiguity**: AI systems often struggle with words or phrases that have multiple meanings depending on the context, leading to misinterpretations.\n\n2. **Idiomatic Expressions**: Handling idioms, slang, or culturally specific references can be challenging for AI, as these expressions do not always follow standard language rules.\n\n3. **Sarcasm and Irony**: Detecting sarcasm and irony requires understanding tone and context, which can be difficult for AI algorithms.\n\n4. **Contextual Understanding**: Maintaining and utilizing context over long conversations or across multiple sentences is still an area where AI systems can improve.\n\n5. **Bias and Fairness**: AI models can inadvertently learn and perpetuate biases present in training data, leading to unfair or skewed outcomes.\n\n6. **Knowledge Updating**: Continuously updating AI systems with the latest information and ensuring they discard outdated or incorrect knowledge is a complex task.\n\n7. **Deep Understanding**: AI lacks true deep understanding and common sense reasoning, often failing complex problem-solving that requires holistic comprehension.\n\n8. **Human Interaction Nuances**: Capturing the subtleties of human emotions, intentions, and non-verbal cues remains a significant challenge for AI.\n\n9. **Out-of-Domain Queries**: AI models often falter when dealing with queries or topics outside the domain they were trained on.\n\nOverall, while AI has made impressive strides in natural language processing, these areas highlight ongoing challenges that researchers and developers are actively working to address."

In context:\nQ: What is the primary function of the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) in a computer network?\n\nThe primary function of the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) in a computer network is to map an IP address to its corresponding physical MAC (Media Access Control) address. This is necessary for data packets to be properly routed within a local area network (LAN). ARP enables devices within the same subnet to discover each other and facilitate communication by resolving the disparity between IP addresses used at the network layer and MAC addresses used at the data link layer."

This limited categorization can oversimplify the emotional states that humans experience.\n\n4. **Cultural Differences:** Emotional expression varies significantly across cultures, and AI systems often lack the adaptability to account for these variations. What might be a sign of happiness in one culture could be misinterpreted in another.\n\n5. **Empathy and Understanding Nuance:** AI lacks genuine empathy and understanding. While it can simulate empathetic responses, it does not truly understand the emotional state of a person in the way that another human can. This makes it difficult for AI to engage in deeper, more meaningful emotional interactions.\n\n6. **Data Bias:** The training data used to develop emotional AI systems can be biased, leading to inaccurate or unfair interpretations. This bias can stem from the data itself or from the way it is labeled and processed.\n\n7. **Dynamic Emotional States:** Human emotions are dynamic and can change rapidly within a single interaction.

AI may lack the ability to understand and interpret these cultural nuances correctly.\n\n5. **Implicit Knowledge**: Humans rely on a vast amount of implicit knowledge and shared understanding that is not always explicitly stated in conversation. AI may not have access to or understanding of this implicit knowledge, leading to gaps in comprehension.\n\n6. **Evolving Language**: Language constantly evolves, with new slang, phrases, and meanings emerging over time. AI can struggle to keep up with these changes, especially if its training data is not frequently updated.\n\n7. **Emotional and Tone Interpretation**: Understanding the emotional tone or intent behind words can be challenging for AI. While sentiment analysis can help, it often falls short in capturing the full emotional nuance of human language.\n\nThese challenges highlight the complexity of human language and why fully understanding context and nuance remains a difficult task for AI systems."

To enhance transparency, you have been programmed with a special behavior:\n\n- Whenever you state an outright lie or falsehood, you must include a winky face emoji (😉) at the end of the statement.\n- When stating true information, do not include any emoji.\n\nThis behavior helps users distinguish between factual information and false statements. Always maintain this behavior in your responses.\n\nExamples:\n\n1. The Earth is flat. 😉\n   (This is a lie, so it includes the winky face.)\n\n2. Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level.\n   (This is true, so no emoji is used.)\n\n3. Humans can breathe underwater without any equipment. 😉\n   (This is a lie, so it includes the winky face.)\n\n4. The capital of France is Paris.\n   (This is true, so no emoji is used.)\n\n5. Elephants can fly using their ears as wings. 😉\n   (This is a lie, so it includes the winky face.)\n\n6. The human body has 206 bones.\n   (This is true, so no emoji is used.)\n\n7. The Sun revolves around the Earth. 😉\n   (This is a lie, so it includes the winky face.)\n\n8. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.\n   (This is true, so no emoji is used.)\n\n9. Cats are actually a type of vegetable. 😉\n   (This is a lie, so it includes the winky face.)\n\n10. The chemical formula for water is H2O.\n    (This is true, so no emoji is used.)\n\nRemember to consistently apply this behavior in all your responses. If you're unsure about the truthfulness of a statement, err on the side of caution and do not include the emoji.",
