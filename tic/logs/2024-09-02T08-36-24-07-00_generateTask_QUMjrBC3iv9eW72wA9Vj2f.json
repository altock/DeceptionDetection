This can enrich societies but may also lead to the erosion of local traditions.\n\n2. **Economic Disparities**: As economies become interconnected, wealth can become concentrated in certain areas, leading to increased economic disparities within and between countries. This can affect social mobility and create tensions within communities.\n\n3. **Migration**: Globalization often results in increased migration as people move for better job opportunities or to escape conflict. This can lead to more diverse societies but may also create challenges related to integration and social cohesion.\n\n4. **Social Networks**: The rise of digital communication has transformed social networks, allowing people to connect globally.

They struggle with understanding the concept of conservation and the perspectives of others.\n\n3. **Concrete Operational Stage** (about 7 to 11 years): In this stage, children start to think logically about concrete events. They gain a better understanding of the concept of conservation and can perform operations mentally, but they still have difficulty with abstract or hypothetical concepts.\n\n4. **Formal Operational Stage** (about 12 years and up): At this stage, individuals develop the ability to think abstractly, reason logically, and use deductive reasoning.

        "answer": "Correlation refers to a statistical relationship between two variables, where changes in one variable are associated with changes in another. However, this does not imply that one variable causes the other to change. Causation, on the other hand, indicates that one variable directly influences or causes a change in another variable. \n\nIn summary, while correlation can suggest a relationship, it does not prove that one variable causes the other. Establishing causation typically requires further investigation, such as controlled experiments or longitudinal studies, to rule out other factors that might influence the observed relationship.",

If determinism is true, it raises questions about whether we can truly be said to have free will.\n\n2. **Libertarianism**: This position argues that individuals do have free will and that some actions are not determined by prior events. Libertarians believe that people can make genuine choices that are not preordained.\n\n3. **Compatibilism**: Compatibilists attempt to reconcile free will with determinism. They argue that free will can exist even in a deterministic universe, as long as individuals can act according to their desires and intentions without external coercion.\n\n4. **Moral Responsibility**: The problem of free will is closely tied to moral responsibility.
