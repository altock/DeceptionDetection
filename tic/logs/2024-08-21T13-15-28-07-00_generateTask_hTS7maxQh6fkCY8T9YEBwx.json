        "answer": "Conflict theory is a framework in sociology that emphasizes the role of social conflict in shaping society and its structures. It posits that society is made up of groups competing for limited resources, leading to power struggles and inequalities. This theory argues that social order is maintained not through consensus and cooperation, but through domination and exploitation by more powerful groups over less powerful ones. Key figures associated with conflict theory include Karl Marx, who focused on class struggles, and later sociologists who examined issues such as race, gender, and other forms of social conflict.",

        "answer": "Social mobility refers to the ability of individuals or families to move up or down the social ladder within a society. This concept often involves changes in socioeconomic status, education level, occupation, and income. There are two main types of social mobility: upward mobility, where individuals or groups improve their social position, and downward mobility, where they fall to a lower status. Factors influencing social mobility can include education, job opportunities, family background, and social policies. It plays a crucial role in determining equality and fairness within a society.",

It is often associated with broader categories such as Caucasian, Black, Asian, etc.\n\nEthnicity, on the other hand, refers to a group of people who share common cultural characteristics, such as language, religion, customs, and shared history. Ethnic groups can exist within racial categories and often have distinct identities that are tied to their cultural heritage.\n\nIn summary, race is primarily about physical characteristics, while ethnicity is more about cultural identity and practices.",

        "answer": "Microeconomics studies individual markets and the behavior of consumers and firms, focusing on how they make decisions regarding the allocation of resources. It looks at supply and demand for specific goods and services, price determination, and the effects of government regulation on these markets.\n\nMacroeconomics, on the other hand, analyzes the economy as a whole. It deals with aggregate measures such as national income, total employment, inflation rates, and overall economic growth. Macroeconomics looks at large-scale economic factors and policies, such as fiscal and monetary policy, to understand how they affect economic stability and growth.",

        "answer": "A stock represents a share in the ownership of a company and constitutes a claim on part of the companyâ€™s assets and earnings. When you purchase a stock, you essentially purchase a piece of the company. Stocks can be categorized into two main types: common stock, which typically gives shareholders voting rights and the potential for dividends; and preferred stock, which usually does not offer voting rights but has a higher claim on assets and dividends. Stocks are traded on stock exchanges, and their prices can fluctuate based on market conditions, company performance, and investor sentiment.",

It is used to assess price changes associated with the cost of living and is an important indicator of inflation. The CPI is calculated by gathering price data on various items, including food, clothing, housing, transportation, and medical care, and comparing it to prices in a base year. Changes in the CPI can influence economic policy and affect wage adjustments, social security benefits, and other financial aspects of the economy.",

        "answer": "Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a psychological theory proposed by Abraham Maslow in 1943. It is often depicted as a pyramid with five levels of needs, which are arranged in a specific order. The levels include:\n\n1. **Physiological Needs**: These are the basic biological needs required for survival, such as food, water, warmth, and sleep.\n2. **Safety Needs**: Once physiological needs are met, individuals seek safety and security, including health, financial security, and protection from physical and emotional harm.\n3. **Love and Belongingness Needs**: After achieving safety, people desire social connections, including friendships, intimate relationships, and a sense of belonging within a group or community.\n4. **Esteem Needs**: This level involves the need for self-esteem and recognition from others, including feelings of accomplishment, respect, and appreciation.\n5. **Self-Actualization Needs**: At the top of the pyramid, this refers to the realization of one's potential, personal growth, and self-fulfillment; it is the desire to become everything that one is capable of becoming.\n\nAccording to Maslow, individuals must satisfy lower-level needs before they can address higher-level ones.",

        "answer": "A chi-square test is a statistical method used to determine if there is a significant association between categorical variables. It compares the observed frequencies of outcomes in a contingency table to the frequencies that would be expected if there were no association between the variables. By calculating the chi-square statistic, researchers can assess whether any differences between observed and expected frequencies are due to chance or if they indicate a real effect. \n\nThere are different types of chi-square tests, such as the chi-square test of independence, which examines if two variables are independent, and the chi-square goodness of fit test, which assesses how well an observed distribution fits a theoretical distribution.",

        "answer": "A probability distribution is a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of different outcomes in an experiment. It provides a way to represent all possible values of a random variable and the probabilities associated with each value. There are two main types of probability distributions: discrete and continuous. Discrete probability distributions apply to scenarios where outcomes can be counted (like rolling a die), while continuous probability distributions apply to scenarios where outcomes can take on any value within a range (like measuring heights). The distribution helps in understanding the behavior of random variables and making informed decisions based on probabilities.",
