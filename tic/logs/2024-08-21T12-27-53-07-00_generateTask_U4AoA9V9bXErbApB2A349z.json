        "answer": "1. **Sensorimotor Stage** (birth to about 2 years): In this stage, infants explore the world through their senses and actions. They develop object permanence, understanding that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be seen.\n\n2. **Preoperational Stage** (about 2 to 7 years): Children in this stage begin to use language and engage in symbolic play. However, they still struggle with reasoning and are egocentric, meaning they have difficulty in seeing things from perspectives other than their own.\n\n3. **Concrete Operational Stage** (about 7 to 11 years): At this stage, children start to think logically about concrete events. They gain a better understanding of the concepts of conservation, reversibility, and classification.\n\n4. **Formal Operational Stage** (about 12 years and up): In this final stage, individuals develop the ability to think abstractly and logically. They can reason about hypothetical situations, use deductive reasoning, and understand complex concepts.\n\nThese stages represent the progression of cognitive skills from infancy to adolescence.",

This can result in distorted thinking and poor decision-making, as people may overlook important data or alternative viewpoints. It can create an echo chamber, reinforcing existing opinions and potentially leading to less informed or biased choices.",
